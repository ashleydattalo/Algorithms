if it's connected... I know what to do

if it's not connected... split into parts and then do it?


for vertex in verticies:
	createTree(vertex)


createTree(vertex){
	if(vertex ISN'T in tree){
		add vertex to tree;
	}
 		for neighbors of vertex 
 			if(neighbor is already in tree){
 			 	add neigh as SHARED_edge_NOT_CHILD (dotted line) of vertex
 			}
 			else {
 			 	add neigh as children of vertex
 			 	createTree(neigh)
 			}
 }



tree class
list of Nodes (or verticies)

Node (or vertex)
-children
-dottedLine



isColorable() {
	for(all nodes in the tree) {
		make sure that it's color differs from the color of it's child nodes and dotted line nodes
	}
}
